# C# Design Patterns

Welcome to the C# Design Patterns repository! This repository aims to provide a comprehensive guide to understanding design patterns in C#. We will cover three main categories of design patterns: Creational Patterns, Structural Patterns, and Behavioral Patterns. The explanations and examples provided here will help you unlock the power of design patterns and apply them effectively in your C# projects.

## Creational Patterns

Creational patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, providing flexibility and control over how objects are created. They help abstract the process of object instantiation and decouple the code that depends on their concrete implementations. In this section, we will explore various creational patterns including:

- **Singleton**: Ensures that only one instance of a class is created and provides a global point of access to it.
- **Factory Method**: Defines an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
- **Abstract Factory**: Provides an interface to create families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Builder**: Separates the construction of complex objects from their representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
- **Prototype**: Creates new objects by cloning existing ones, avoiding the need for explicit instantiation.

## Structural Patterns

Structural patterns focus on class and object composition, enabling the creation of flexible and efficient structures. They deal with relationships between objects, simplifying the design and making it easier to modify or extend existing systems. In this section, we will explore various structural patterns including:

- **Adapter**: Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together by converting the interface of one object into another expected by clients.
- **Bridge**: Decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing them to vary independently.
- **Composite**: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, treating individual objects and compositions uniformly.
- **Decorator**: Dynamically adds responsibilities to objects by wrapping them with one or more decorators, providing a flexible alternative to subclassing.
- **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to use and understand.
- **Proxy**: Provides a placeholder or surrogate for another object to control access, add additional behavior, or delay instantiation.

## Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns focus on communication between objects, facilitating the interaction and coordination of various components. They help define common communication patterns and provide solutions for managing complex workflows. In this section, we will explore various behavioral patterns including:

- **Observer**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- **Strategy**: Encapsulates interchangeable algorithms within a family, allowing clients to switch between them at runtime.
- **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object, decoupling senders from receivers and enabling parameterization of clients with different requests.
- **Iterator**: Provides a way to access elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying structure.
- **State**: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes, appearing as if it has changed its class.
- **Template Method**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, allowing subclasses to redefine certain steps without changing the overall structure.

We hope you find this repository helpful in understanding and applying design patterns in your C# projects. Each pattern comes with detailed explanations and examples to assist you in implementing them effectively. Happy coding!
